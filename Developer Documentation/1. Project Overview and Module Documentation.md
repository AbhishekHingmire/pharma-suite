---

### 4.3 Purchase Module

**Purpose**: Manage medicine procurement from pharmaceutical companies

**Sub-Modules:**

#### A. New Purchase
**Flow:**
1. **Step 1: Select Company**
   - Display all active companies
   - Show payment terms, contact info
   
2. **Step 2: Add Products**
   - Select product from master list
   - Enter brand name manually (Important: Same generic can have multiple brands)
   - Enter quantity
   - **Scheme Selection (Intelligent)**:
     - System shows available schemes for selected company + product
     - Displays: "Buy X Get Y Free" or "X% Discount"
     - Shows scheme status: Active/Expired/Upcoming
     - Auto-calculates free quantity based on purchase quantity
     - Minimum quantity validation (scheme not applied if qty insufficient)
   - Enter batch number
   - Enter expiry date
   - Enter rate per unit
   - System calculates amount = qty × rate
   
3. **Scheme Application Logic**:
   - Example: Scheme "Buy 10 Get 2 Free"
   - User orders 25 units
   - System calculates: floor(25/10) × 2 = 4 free units
   - Total received: 25 + 4 = 29 units
   - Effective rate: (25 × rate) / 29
   
4. **Payment Details**:
   - **Pending**: Full amount to be paid later (default for staff)
   - **Paid Now**: Requires transaction ID, payment method (Admin only)
   - **Partial Payment**: Enter paid amount, pending auto-calculated (Admin only)
   
5. **Summary & Save**:
   - Subtotal calculation
   - GST @ 12% (configurable)
   - Total amount
   - Save creates:
     - Purchase record
     - Updates inventory (qty + freeQty added)
     - Creates payment record if paid/partial

**Business Rules:**
- Brand name must be entered manually (same medicine, different brands)
- Scheme validation: minimum quantity check
- Free quantity verification required (checkbox for staff to confirm receipt)
- Payment authorization: Only admin can mark as paid
- Inventory auto-updated on purchase save

#### B. Purchase List
**Features:**
- Filter: All / Paid / Pending
- Display: Invoice number, company, date, products count, total, payment status, pending amount
- Actions: View details, Edit, Delete (admin only)

### 4.4 Sales Module

**Purpose**: Manage medicine sales to customers (retailers/pharmacies)

**Sub-Modules:**

#### A. New Sale
**Flow:**
1. **Step 1: Select Customer**
   - Display customers with type (A/B/C)
   - Show credit limit, outstanding amount
   - Credit validation: outstanding + new sale ≤ credit limit
   
2. **Step 2: Add Products**
   - Select product (shows available batches)
   - Select company/brand (inventory-based)
   - Select batch (shows available qty, expiry date)
   - Enter quantity (validation: qty ≤ available qty)
   - **Dynamic Rate Calculation**:
     - System fetches customer type (A/B/C)
     - Retrieves margin % from Rate Master
     - Calculates: Selling Price = Cost Price × (1 + margin%)
     - Displays rate automatically
   - Amount = qty × rate
   
3. **Rate Master Logic**:
   - Customer Type A: 30% margin → Higher profit
   - Customer Type B: 20% margin → Medium profit
   - Customer Type C: 15% margin → Lower profit (bulk buyers)
   
4. **Payment Status**:
   - Paid: Full payment received
   - Unpaid: Credit sale
   - Partial: Partial payment received
   
5. **Inventory Impact**:
   - Stock deducted from selected batch
   - FIFO principle: oldest batch prioritized
   - Batch tracking maintained

**Business Rules:**
- Cannot sell expired products
- Cannot oversell (qty validation)
- Dynamic pricing based on customer type
- Credit limit enforcement
- Batch-wise inventory deduction

#### B. Sales List
**Features:**
- Search by invoice, customer name
- Display: Date, customer, invoice, products, amount, status
- Actions: View details, Edit (if unpaid), Delete (admin)

---

### 4.5 Inventory Module

#### B. Batch Details (Eye Icon)
- Detailed view of all batches for selected product
- Batch number, quantity, purchase date, expiry, rate
- Color coding:
  - 🔴 Red: Expired
  - 🟡 Amber: Expiring soon (< 30 days)
  - 🟢 Green: Fresh stock

#### C. Stock Alerts
- **Out of Stock**: Quantity = 0 (shows red product name only)
- **Low Stock**: Quantity < minimum stock level
- **Near Expiry**: Products expiring within 30/60/90 days

**Business Logic:**
- Inventory updated on:
  - Purchase: Stock IN (qty + freeQty)
  - Sales: Stock OUT (batch-wise deduction)
- Batch tracking for recalls and expiry management
- FIFO (First In First Out) for sales
- FEFO (First Expiry First Out) recommended

## 5. Data Flow and Relationships

### Entity Relationships

```
Company (1) -------- (N) Purchase
Company (1) -------- (N) Scheme
Company (1) -------- (N) Inventory (via Purchase)

Product (1) -------- (N) Purchase Items
Product (1) -------- (N) Sales Items
Product (1) -------- (N) Inventory Batches
Product (1) -------- (N) Rate Master
Product (1) -------- (N) Scheme (if product-specific)

Customer (1) -------- (N) Sales
Customer (1) -------- (N) Payments
Customer (1) -------- (N) Rate Master (via type)

Purchase (1) -------- (N) Purchase Items
Purchase (1) -------- (N) Inventory Batches (created on purchase)

Sale (1) -------- (N) Sales Items
Sale (1) -------- (N) Payments

Inventory Batch -------- Product (N:1)
Inventory Batch -------- Company (N:1)
```

### Data Flow: Purchase to Sale Cycle

```
1. PURCHASE
   ↓
   Company selected → Products added → Scheme applied → Payment status
   ↓
2. INVENTORY UPDATE
   ↓
   New batches created with (qty + freeQty)
   ↓
3. RATE MASTER
   ↓
   Selling prices calculated based on customer type
   ↓
4. SALE
   ↓
   Customer selects product → System shows selling rate → Batch deducted
   ↓
5. PAYMENT COLLECTION
   ↓
   Payment received → Outstanding updated
```

## 6. Business Logic

### 6.1 Scheme Application Logic

**Free Quantity Scheme:**
```
Scheme: Buy 10 Get 2 Free
Purchase Quantity: 37

Calculation:
- Multiplier = floor(37 / 10) = 3
- Free Quantity = 3 × 2 = 6
- Total Received = 37 + 6 = 43
- Effective Rate = (37 × rate) / 43
```

**Validation:**
- Scheme not applied if qty < minimum required
- Shows warning: "Minimum quantity required: 10, Current: 5"

### 6.2 Dynamic Pricing Logic

**Rate Calculation:**
```
Product Cost Price (from inventory): ₹100
Customer Type: A
Margin from Rate Master: 30%

Selling Price = 100 × (1 + 0.30) = ₹130
```

**Minimum Price Check:**
```
if (calculatedPrice < minPrice) {
  sellingPrice = minPrice; // Floor price enforcement
}
```

### 6.3 Credit Limit Validation

**Check:**
```
Customer Credit Limit: ₹50,000
Current Outstanding: ₹35,000
New Sale Amount: ₹20,000

Available Credit = 50,000 - 35,000 = ₹15,000

if (newSaleAmount > availableCredit) {
  // Show error: "Credit limit exceeded"
  // Remaining credit: ₹15,000
}
```

### 6.4 Stock Deduction (FIFO)

**Logic:**
```
Product: Paracetamol
Sale Quantity: 25

Inventory Batches:
1. Batch A: Qty 10, Expiry: 2025-01
2. Batch B: Qty 20, Expiry: 2025-03
3. Batch C: Qty 15, Expiry: 2025-05

Deduction:
1. Deduct 10 from Batch A (oldest)
2. Deduct 15 from Batch B
3. Batch C unchanged

Result:
- Batch A: 0
- Batch B: 5
- Batch C: 15
```

### 6.5 Payment Allocation

**Auto-allocation (Oldest First):**
```
Customer Outstanding: ₹100,000
Invoices:
1. INV-001: ₹30,000 (30 days old)
2. INV-002: ₹40,000 (15 days old)
3. INV-003: ₹30,000 (5 days old)

Payment Received: ₹50,000

Allocation:
1. INV-001: ₹30,000 (fully paid)
2. INV-002: ₹20,000 (partial - ₹20,000 pending)
3. INV-003: ₹0 (unpaid)

New Outstanding: ₹50,000
```
